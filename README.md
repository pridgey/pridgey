# Hej! 

I'm Taylor and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for UI/UX design.

I specialize in React and enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces that are both beautiful and functional. Recently, I've been exploring Solid.js and have been really impressed with its performance and simplicity. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, and I enjoy collaborating with other developers to create innovative solutions. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

Assuming you're here to get to know me, here's two truths and a lie!
1. I once worked as a stunt-driver for a TV show
2. I've only received one speeding ticket in my life
3. I tried the whole Youtuber thing once
